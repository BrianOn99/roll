roll
====

Show how an object move in a system.  Just a leisure time killer project.

The system consist of a runway (given by a parametric curve), gravity, and an
object rolling in the runway.

The logic is written in the module "runwaylib.py". "roller.py" is an
application using the module. Running it will create an mp4 clip showing a
strange (really strange) ball(s?) moving in a roller coaster track.
